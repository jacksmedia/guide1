So much future technology to learn, as the world enters a new monetary age! Here's a vivid yet technical rundown so you can start thriving with this new currency & even explain some of it to your loved ones. 😹🤞

## 🗃⛓☁️ Blockchains are Public Thumbdrives

Bitcoin is a blockchain, right? So what's a blockchain? You can start off by picturing a big (but not super big, still under 1TB) *"public thumbdrive"* that always lives in The Cloud. When crypto developers and engineers 'run nodes' on a blockchain, they are either:
- helping run that network
- interacting with that network

but it's always the same big, "public thumbdrive". 

:::tip
⛓ A blockchain is an extremely secure data system that's actually made up of linked records-- that's why the term block*chain* has caught on. ⛓
:::tip

When someone owns Bitcoin (BTC), that ownership record is permanently kept on the BTC blockchain. The main functional parts of a blockchain are the linked records and the computer system that runs the network. Blockchains are mathematically very secure, and that's why Bitcoin actually works as a monetary system and is more than just a new type of open source software (keep reading for more on Web 3.0 later in this piece).


## ⛏ ➡️ 🏦 Validators, They Who Run Nodes (Miners)

Validators used to go by the term 'miner' or 'cryptominer' a few years ago. They've always provided the math that powers the blockchains by running huge computer banks-- the Bitcoin validators ARE the Bitcoin blockchain, which is what makes this a decentralised technology. Now that it's a big money, legit industry that can arrange  to repurpose old power plants [1](https://interestingengineering.com/crypto-miners-buying-power-plants)
[2](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-58020010) and aluminum factories [3](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/bitcoin-miner-revamps-alcoas-aluminum-factory.html) [4](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/30/russian-aluminum-plant-pivots-to-bitcoin-mining-following-us-sanctions/), the term has upgraded, too. 

> Validators: teams and companies that run computing machinery that powers a blockchain

Validators earn fractional amounts of the blockchain currency they support as rewards, so this decentralised technology nevertheless is balanced out by a business model that favors larger operators. Yet some cryptos are created to intentionally foil this, meaning that their blockchain's algorithm doesn't work dramatically better in professional validator mines; these are the cryptos that hobbyists are still mining on old gaming PCs. The economics that determine rewards for validators (tokenomics) vary, and are nowadays often subject to popular review and can be changed in a democratic fashion (DAOs).

## 👛📝 Crypto Wallets, Blockchains and The Twelve Words

In this sense "wallets" are private accounts that can write data to blockchains. Crypto is open source and blockchains are freely available to access, yet their account recovery is 100% the responsibility of the owner. Please take your own financial security seriously-- there is no central authority whom you can email to reset your access keys. (But stay tuned for exchanges, in a moment.) The wallet keys are Twelve Words that you really ought to write down and store someplace safe.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) for phones and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) for Chrome-type browsers are the two mainstream crypto wallet apps. When you set up TrustWallet or MetaMask, the app will offer you the Twelve Words and it will strongly encourage you to save these words offline, in a very reliable and safe place. Please take this advice, and *never share the Twelve Words with anyone-- this is the exact same thing as giving away your wallet*.

So regarding your adventures in crypto going forward, just be careful and use your own best judgment and best note-taking tricks and you'll do great. Nobody can watch out for you better than yourself! Enjoy gaining power and fluency in the world of blockchains and crypto, and congratulations for learning about this strange new tech.

:::danger
Seriously, NEVER share the 12 Words, the words = the wallet!
:::danger

What about hardware wallets? Some people only feel safe when they "save" their crypto to a special hardware wallet, separate from their phone. Yet the crypto doesn't exist inside the hardware wallet, it's still on the blockchain. Guess what happens inside that fancy hardware, versus your smartphone or browser wallet app? Complex math that exactly equals the password strength of twelve randomized words. 😼🤷

So it's your choice! With the simple strategy, when you change smartphones and have to update your wallet app, all you need to do is download the app again and then re-enter the dozen words. I prefer to use a small paper notebook and inexpensive phones in this simple strategy, versus a unique and expensive piece of hardware that will almost certainly *permanently remove my access to my blockchain money* if it turns into a brick... but YMMV. Some people really love hardware.


:::tip
Whether you rely on a hardware wallet or not, you will always be accessing your crypto by accessing a blockchain.
:::tip

We cannot erase blockchain data! The tech only allows for writing more data, so it's actually a super-transparent ledger and not very helpful to black markets and white collar criminals. The biggest occupational risk for a hacker these days is not using enough different crypto wallets for their crimes, because they get caught easily when police simply follow [the public transaction data on the blockchains](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)!

Wallets write to blockchains, exchanges write to blockchains. So why use an exchange at all, when you have complete control over your own wallet, and exchanges can lock down or delay access to funds? We believe that the #1 reason for most people seems to be that an exchange account is recoverable. Emailing Coinbase when you forget your password will lead to a reset and recovery situation, whereas if you lose your notebook with your wallet words, you've effectively lost all access to your crypto.

Another reason to work with exchanges even once you become fluent moving crypto around using just your wallet is simplicity. Major breakthroughs like blockchain tech tend to lead to a crazy diversity of experiments and yes *different flavors of blockchain* are very much front and center in the crypto discussion in 2021. Without getting lost in the sauce about blockchain flavors right now, we just want you know that the exchanges (like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jacks_pv)) help to quickly convert your crypto between different chains-- you can do this with a wallet, too, but you may need to visit several swaps or dexes & pay multiple small transaction (gas) fees and it's a chore to do by hand when an exchange has this all automated with code contracts and will perhaps even cost you less (more on this when we get to Layer 1 and Layer 2 tech).

## 🧱 🆚 🪙 Flavors of Crypto: Tokens vs Coins like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Zcash
Bitcoin was created and begun anonymously sometime in 2009: this is bizarre and wonderful and inarguably mysterious yet it's also somehow true. Because the BTC blockchain technology is open source it's easy to copy and modify, and because it's robust and "Just Works" thousands of curious spin-offs (like we said, flavors of blockchain) have appeared. Bitcoin's blockchain is running on millions of computers (nodes) worldwide, which is the biggest reason it's exciting as a "government-proof" money system. Zcash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and *many* others are all basically different flavors of Bitcoin, although some cool tweaks exist that we'll completely gloss over and leave to your research. 😼

But there was one very big innovation, since 2009... the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain is programmable, unlike Bitcoin's. The bits and pieces of Ethereum become *tokens*, and these tokens are pure code so they can be made to work like legal contracts, game pieces, or plain ol' regular crypto coins. This advancement over blockchain tech is termed ['smart contracts'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract), so please [check out Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) for a deep dive and just keep in mind that 'smart' blockchains can make new crypto, but traditional blockchains cannot do this. Naturally, there are hundreds of smart chains since this innovation was published in 2014. Some of the new distributed apps (DApps) *running on chain* already cover traditional app niches like stock exchange, currency exchange, utility tools, and even games-- although the games are mostly casinos. 🤑

> Smart chains can mint new cryptos called tokens; tokens don't have their own blockchain, they're made on a chain like Solana or Ethereum or BSC

Because smart blockchains can build new cryptos out of tokens, it's difficult to directly compare Bitcoin to something like Binance Smart Chain (BSC/BNB). While Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and a unique type of commodity, the [BSC is already erupting into an ecosystem](https://docs.binance.org/faq/bsc/eco.html)-- something more like Amazon or Microsoft! If you want to build wealth in this new monetary world, it would make sense to learn about both the old guard coin-type assets as well as the upcoming smart contract blockchains where people create new cryptos, NFTs (collectibles), and interactive worlds of art and media (the metaverse).

## 🌌💽 DApps = Distributed Apps running on Smart Crypto = Web 3.0

Web 3.0 has arrived! Crypto smartchains are programmable, so they are becoming a separate, layered zone within the existing Internet. It's crazy living through another technology revolution when the memories of dial-up modems still exist with some of us, but we cannot slow human ingenuity! Original blockchains are called Layer 1 tech, while the newer projects that have grown from and around them are Layer 2. Most Layer 2 chains exist to facilitate or discount transactions on Layer 1 chains (the gas prices).

Here are some examples of projects built on Ethereum (with ERC-20 token tech) meaning they are running on the power of thousands of computers (the blockchain nodes) all over Earth. When you visit these in your wallet app or web browser, you're accessing a new kind of Internet that's served to you from many places at once instead of your local ISP edgepoint. It's also extremely, differently secure than the normal Internet, but that's a bit too technical for right now. 😹

### Ethereum DApps, quick list of 3
- [UniSwap](https://uniswap.org/), very broadly, a crypto exchange
- [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), financial instruments built upon crypto
- [AxieInifinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), combat and breeding game, generates collectibles (NFTs)

There are many smartchains. The potential for this tech is completely unrealised and barely explored, and has *at least* as many applications as our commerical internet. 🤯  So here is some logistical advice for you, certainly not financial-- read about new smartchain projects, [join Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jacks_pv), and try to invest in new smartchains that get listed before they become popular... we believe this to be logistically sound, if not financially sound, advice on how to cope with the pace of technology change! Owning more programmable, recordkeeping currency is smarter than owning less in the 2020s, right? 😸

### Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
Binance is definitely the world's largest and possibly the world's most visionary crypto exchange. Like every large exchange they issued a flagship coin (BNB) as a clone of Bitcoin when they launched, and this has become valuable along with Binance's dominance in the crypto exchange space. What's visionary about Binance was their choice to pivot and overhaul their BNB coin to allow them tap into the promise of Ethereum's smartchain tech; about a year ago [Binance Smart Chain with its BSC token launched](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/binance-smart-chain-vs-ethereum-what-s-the-difference), which can be swapped at nearly 1-for-1 with existing BNB. So about a year ago billions of dollars of real-world value that was already invested into the BNB coin suddenly became a programmable asset, and the BSC ecosystem of decentralised finance (DeFi) began erupting with projects-- it has already surpassed established smartchain king Ethereum's transaction volume.

There's always a catch, of course: Binance is infamous for mainly controlling their network validators "in house", unlike the open source nature of Ethereum and Bitcoin whose millions of validator nodes are run by thousands of companies and spread all over Earth. No one's entirely sure where the Binance network runs (nor where the exchange is legally headquartered! 👀), but the smartchain is *fast and extremely affordable* to use versus most competition. 

Because the BSC has such low transaction fees (fresher tech plus their centralised validator scheme, perhaps?) and such explosive platform growth, Binance has really helped spur a technology race in the smartchain industry. Solving their chain's expensive gas price issue as well as Binance, or better, is a key goal for the Ethereum dev team and they are [planning to launch Ethereum v2 by end of this year](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) to make the entire system of sending, spending, and building with Ethereum tokens radically cheaper.

#### Binance on-chain programs (DApps), quick list of 3
- [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/), flagship [DEX](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) for the BSC chain
- [Jetswap.finance](https://jetswap.finance/), crosschain DEX, both BSC and Polygon/Matic
- [CryptoBlades](https://www.cryptoblades.io/), fantasy combat game with collectible (NFT) pieces

## 💸🛁 Liquidity & DeFi

Finally, let's *slightly* explain DeFi. Know that there's a class of crypto users who stake real world money like yen & USD in support of tokens-- they provide liquidity against the asset, like a lender. While you can build just about anything with smartchains, this new industry is all about financial leverage, which can get *exotic* but mostly means locking real-world money into a crypto for a set period of time and then receiving rewards like new tokens or coins in return. Money makes money, just like every human endeavor since Croesus invented capitalism! 😅🎩

DeFi uses AIs (naturally, because this is unregulated finance, and we're living in the future) which are termed Automated Market Makers (AMMs), and the returns are Very Good... this is proving disruptively popular, whether or not it's exactly news. Want proof? So much money has flowed into DeFi DApps that [Ethereum alone is currently worth more than VISA](https://www.financialexpress.com/market/ethereum-now-more-valuable-than-visa-jpmorgan-chase-bitcoin-rival-among-top-five-financial-services/2247384/). Did you know?

# Bitcoin vs Ethereum, recap

*(Ethereum vs Binance vs Polkadot vs Solana vs Avalanche) vs Bitcoin* is the most top-down take, actually. All of these except Bitcoin are smart blockchains with the ability to run software. It's our belief, based on several years of following this technology, that smartchains will revolutionise much of our world and will become as ubiquitous as smartphone tech nowadays by the 2040s. Just consider the valuation of Ethereum, which wasn't even online in 2013!

As always, *This is not financial advice!* 😼

We hope you've learned a few useful pointers from this run through. Stay tuned, for these posts are continually under revision for clarity, and any content referenced above that didn't show up yet is certainly coming up soon.
