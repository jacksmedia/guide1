So much future technology to learn, as the world enters a new monetary age! Here's a vivid yet technical rundown so you can start thriving with this new currency & even explain some of it to your loved ones. 😹🤞

## 🗃☁️ Blockchains

These are big, very big, public thumbdrives that always live in The Cloud.

Some people only feel safe when they "save" their Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, separate from their phone. Whether you rely on a hardware wallet *(a single point of failure, with a battery!?)* or not, you will always be accessing crypto by accessing a blockchain.

We cannot erase blockchain data! The tech only allows for writing more data, so it's actually a super-transparent ledger and not very helpful to black markets and white collar criminals. The biggest occupational risk for a hacker these days is not using *dozens* of different wallets, because they get caught easily when police simply follow the public transaction data on the blockchain!

Wallets write to blockchains, exchanges write to blockchains. So why use an exchange at all, when you can control you own wallet? It's a case of **different flavors of blockchain**, of course-- major breakthroughs like blockchain tech tend to lead to a crazy diversity of experiments. The exchanges help to quickly convert crypto between blockchains, instead of visiting several swaps or dexes with your wallet.

## 🧱 🆚 🪙 Tokens vs Coins like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Zcash
Bitcoin was created and begun anonymously sometime in 2009. The Bitcoin blockchain is easy to copy (and modify), so thousands of curious spin-offs have appeared. Bitcoin's blockchain is running on millions of computers worldwide, which is the biggest reason it's exciting as a "government-proof" money system. Zcash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and *many* others are all basically different colors of Bitcoin, although some cool tweaks exist that I'll completely gloss over and leave to your research. 😼

However: the Ethereum blockchain is programmable, unlike Bitcoin's. The bits and pieces of Ethereuem become tokens, and these tokens are pure code so they can be made to work like legal contracts, game pieces, or plain ol' regular crypto coins. This advancement over plain blockchain database tech is termed ['smart contracts'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract), so please [check out Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) for a deep dive and just keep in mind that 'smart' blockchains can make new tokens, but traditional ones cannot. Naturally, there are hundreds of smart blockchains since this innovation was published in 2014. Some of these function like hybrid stock markets, some are utility tools, some are mostly casinos. 🤑

> Smart blockchains can literally create new blockchains

Because smart blockchains can build new cryptos out of tokens, it's difficult to directly compare Bitcoin to something like Binance Smart Chain. While BTC is clearly the original cryptocurrency and a unique store of value, the [BSC is already erupting into an ecosystem](https://docs.binance.org/faq/bsc/eco.html)-- something more like Amazon or Microsoft! If you want to build wealth in this new monetary world, it would make sense to learn about both the old guard coin-type assets as well as the upcoming smart contract landscape where people create new cryptos, NFTs, and similar unique things!

### 🌌💽 DApps = Distributed Apps running on Smart Crypto

Here are some examples of projects built on Ethereum (with ERC-20 token tech) meaning they are running on the power of thousands of computers all over Earth. When you visit these in your browser, you're accessing a new kind of internet, served from many places at once instead of your local edgepoint. You'll also see prompts to connect a wallet, but hang tight for now and just browse around.

#### Binance Smart Chain
 uses a clone of ERC-20 called BEP-20. This overlaps with the Binance exchange's flagship coin (BNB), which is closer to BTC than ETH so they only grafted the two techs together in 2020 but things have really taken off in the past twelve months! Binance represents the largest user base of any exchange, and they are infamous for mainly controlling the validators "in house" unlike the open source nature of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Just like Ethereum, people use BEP-20 tokens to create new cryptos & NFTs. Unlike ETH, the BSC has very low transaction fees, (because of their centralised validator scheme, perhaps?) which is something that the Ethereuem team is racing to compete with, as of September 2021-- they are [planning to launch version 2 by end of this year](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/).

## ⛏ ➡️ 🏦 Validators

> Teams and companies that run machinery that powers the blockchain

Validators used to go by the term 'miner' or 'cryptominer' a few years ago. They've always provided the math that powers the blockchains by running huge computer banks-- the Bitcoin validators ARE the Bitcoin blockchain, which is what makes this a decentralised technology. Now that it's a big money, legit industry that repurposes old power plants and aluminum factories, the term has spiffed up, too.

# Bitcoin vs Ethereum, recap
Ethereum vs Binance vs Polygon vs Solana vs Bitcoin is the most top-down take, actually. All of these except Bitcoin are 'smartchains' with the ability to run software. It's our belief, based on several years of following this technology, that smartchains will revolutionise much of our world and will become as ubiquitous as smartphone tech nowadays by the 2040s. This is not finiancial advice! 😼

Stay tuned for more, soon.
