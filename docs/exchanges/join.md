# Let's Join Coinbase & Valora

Coinbase works with Ethereum & Bitcoin, and many more cryptos and tokens than you've likely heard of before. Valora lets you send money to anyone with an email, and also lets you buy and sell their CELO currency. You can actually skip Valora for now if you're eager to just grab some Bitcoin or Ethereum and come back and sign up for Valora later, but it's pretty easy to knock out both applications at once so why not just get it over with as a two for one?

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ“Š Download Coinbase app


We recommended Coinbase as a good first exchange. Here are the download links:

Never, ever use the same password for both of these apps. In fact-- never, ever reuse a password for anything! You can [use this site](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) to create very strong passwords (make them 20+ characters long) and save them somewhere safe & offline.

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ“Š Download Valora app

Valora has a more specific function than Coinbase-- it's a crypto version of Venmo, basically.

Valora lets you:
- quickly send CELO Dollars (cUSD) to an email address
- convert CELO back and forth from cUSD, and also to your local currency
- withdraw your local currency to your checking account

If you're patient and careful you can buy CELO low and wait to sell it back to cUSD when it's higher and turn a profit. This is a very basic and easy way to invest in the disruptive force that is cryptocurrency, as it ruthlessly changes our world!

If you don't have any interest in sending money to family or friends, and don't want to ever worry about CELO, then skip Valora entirely! Just grab Coinbase and don't worry another moment about it. *Good job getting yourself into cryptocurrency, friend!*

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ§­ Google Authenticator

One More Item Before You Go...

Please also download Google Authenticator, for 1-in-a-million security *(yes, it's like rolling a d10<sup>6</sup>)* because Coinbase (and any other major crypto exchange you decide to use) will require this magical app to prove yourself and keep your crypto safe. You'll need to use this app whenever you move crypto around, because then you get two factors of authentication-- this app plus your password. That's all there is to 2FA of MFA (two- or multi-factor authentication), but it's incredibly important for your security and the safety of your money.

- [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)

> Why is it like rolling a million-sided die? Because the Authenticator uses RSA key tech, which syncs your device ID with the exchange's record of your login, and then keeps re-rolling a 6-digit number every 60 seconds (also in sync with the exchange's software) to provide a 1 in 10<sup>6</sup> chance of anyone else spoofing your device. You can also think about it as 6d10s, if the idea of a die with one million tiny triangle sides bothers you (it bothers me, and I can't find any models of it so it's tough to imagine).
