# Let's Join Coinbase & Valora

Coinbase sells and trades Ethereum & Bitcoin, and many more cryptos and tokens than you've likely heard of before. Valora lets you send money to anyone with an email, and also rewards you generously when you keep some money in your account.

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ“Š Download Coinbase app

We recommended Coinbase as a good first exchange. Connecting your checking account allows you to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, and [all of these](https://www.coinbase.com/browse) coins and tokens. What's the difference between a crypto coin and a crypto token? Check out our [Blockchain piece](/blog/how-to-grok-crypto) for that, and more.

Here are the download links:
- [Android](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jacks_pv)
- [iPhone](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jacks_pv)

Never, ever use the same password for both of these apps. In fact-- never, ever reuse a password for anything! You can [use this site](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) to create very strong passwords (make them 20+ characters long) and save them somewhere safe & offline.

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ“Š Download Valora app

Valora has a more specific function than Coinbase-- it's a crypto version of Venmo, basically. Yet the app also rewards you with a generous 50% APR *(at time of writing)* so holding cUSD will earn you a surprisingly large passive income.

Valora lets you:
- buy cUSD (custom currency called Celo Dollars) with a debit card
- convert cUSD back and forth from CELO, the Valora app token
- quickly send CELO to an email address or another Valora user
- withdraw USD to your checking account
- earn 50% per year on the cUSD balance

Two things to note here:

### ðŸª„ Passive income through simply holding money in Valora

Significantly higher than anything offered by any bank on Earth. Crypto (and DeFi)
 are disruptive and magical!

### ðŸ”„ USD -> cUSD -> CELO -> cUSD -> CELO -> cUSD -> etc
If you're patient and careful you can buy CELO low and wait to sell it back to cUSD when it's higher and turn a profit. This is a very basic and easy way to invest in the disruptive force that is cryptocurrency, as it ruthlessly changes our world!

If you don't have any interest in sending money to family or friends without big fees, and don't want to earn hefty passive income, then skip Valora entirely! Just grab Coinbase and don't worry another moment about it. *Good job getting yourself into cryptocurrency, friend!*

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ§­ Google Authenticator

One More Item Before You Go...

Please also download Google Authenticator, for 1-in-a-million security *(yes, it's like rolling a d10<sup>6</sup>)* because Coinbase (and any other major crypto exchange you decide to use) will require this magical app to prove yourself and keep your crypto safe. You'll need to use this app whenever you move crypto around, because then you get two factors of authentication-- this app plus your password. That's all there is to 2FA of MFA (two- or multi-factor authentication), but it's incredibly important for your security and the safety of your money.

> Why is it like rolling a million-sided die? Because the Authenticator uses RSA key tech, which syncs your device ID with the exchange's record of your login, and then keeps re-rolling a 6-digit number every 60 seconds (also in sync with the exchange's software) to provide a 1 in 10<sup>6</sup> chance of anyone else spoofing your device. You can also think about it as 6d10s, if the idea of a die with one million tiny triangle sides bothers you (it bothers me, and I can't find any models of it so it's tough to imagine).
