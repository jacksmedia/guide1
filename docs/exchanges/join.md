# Let's Join Coinbase & KuCoin

Coinbase works with Ethereum & Bitcoin, KuCoin has rare and interesting tokens. You can actually skip KuCoin for now if you're eager to just grab some Bitcoin or Ethereum and come back and sign up later, but it's pretty easy to knock out both applications at once so why not just get it over with as a two for one?

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ“Š Download Coinbase app


We recommended Coinbase as a good first exchange. Here are the download links:

- [iPhone](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jacks_pv)

Never, ever use the same password for both of these exchanges. In fact-- never, ever reuse a password for anything! You can [use this site](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) to create very safe passwords (make them 20+ characters long).

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ“Š Download KuCoin app

KuCoin is astounding because they have a larger variety of cryptos than Coinbase, and they have many more ways to use your wealth. We'll only scratch the surface of KuCoin today, so don't worry too much and good job getting yourself into cryptocurrency!

## ðŸ“¥ðŸ§­ Google Authenticator

One More Item Before You Go...

Please also download Google Authenticator, for 1-in-a-million security *(yes, it's like rolling a d10<sup>6</sup>)* because both exchanges will require this magical app to prove yourself and keep your crypto safe. You'll need to use this app whenever you move crypto around with an exchange, because then you're getting two factors of authentication-- this app plus your password. That's all there is to 2FA of MFA (two or multi-factor authentication), but it's incredibly important for your security and the safety of your money.

> Why is it like rolling a million-sided die? Because the Authenticator uses RSA key tech, which syncs your device ID with the exchange's record of your login, and then keeps re-rolling a 6-digit number every 60 seconds (also in sync with the exchange's software) to provide a 1 in 10<sup>6</sup> chance of anyone else spoofing your device. You can also think about it as 6d10s, if the idea of a die with one million tiny triangle sides bothers you (it bothers me, and I can't find any models of it so it's tough to imagine).
