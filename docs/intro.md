# Getting Started

Let's acquire your first cryptocurrency *in less than 15 minutes*.

## Getting Squared Away

Set aside **these things** to get set up!

### 📱 Smart Phone ONLY YOU have access to
If you want to buy a basic android phone and only use it for crypto, that’s aces and a super smart choice!

### 🏧💳 Bank account with Checking/Debit features
To buy crypto from exchanges with USD; also, to deposit USD from exchanges.

### 📇📸 Driver License or Passport, or similar ID
Cropped, **clear pic** of the front of the license and one of the back. Two pics total. If using a passport, take one pic of the entire headshot & name page. Have the pic(s) ready to upload from your phone (find where they are!).

### 📝🖋 Note paper, notepad, etc & pen
You will soon create a special note with today’s date.

### 📋 Also, any study tools
Use whatever you like best when you're learning; just make sure that you record new info from this site in your own words, so you actually learn it. Copy/Paste if you must, but then try  editing the text a bit and see what happens to your retention.
