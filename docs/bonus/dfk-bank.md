This is real, anon. A bank in a game can still earn you huge yields.  🙀🕹🎩💰 #DeFi powers the game called #DeFiKingdoms on the #HarmonyONE #blockchain.

Farming RPGs are known for their depth of economy so of course there is a Bank you can visit. It's near the gates of the city, right of center on the World Map.

The tiny Bank is definitely sporting a $JEWEL sign.

![DeFiKingdoms Bank - step 1](../../static/img/dfkd.png)

Go there. Interact with the Teller NPC (Ian) and you'll receive the chance to invest your JEWEL tokens.

Ian has a racket going where he exchanges JEWEL into xJEWEL... which then magically grows over time. APR LFG, especially when you consider the potential value of JEWEL.

That's it, anon. Check bank in a few days' time and keep good notes on your #DeFiant journey, because you're in a new world now!
