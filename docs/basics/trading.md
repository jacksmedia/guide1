# üîÅüîÑ Trade Crypto

When you exchange (swap) Bitcoin for something else, you're moving money across two different blockchains. This requires software like TrustWallet or an exchange like Coinbase.

## Coinbase Exchange, one of Many Exchanges
- Very easy, Great UI
- May cost more than a swap
- Choose from extensive list
- No dangerous coins allowed
- Mistakes recoverable

## DungeonSwap, one of Many Swaps
- Only important if you're on Binance Smart Chain
- Very powerful
- Contract Address may be required
- You may indeed import dangerous coins!
- Unforgiving = no failsafe

You will need to visit [DungeonSwap](https://dungeonswap.finance) in your TrustWallet Dapp browser... unless you're adventuresome enough to have a browser extension like MetaMask.

Here's the address: ```https://dungeonswap.finance```

PS: The first step is to [join Coinbase.
