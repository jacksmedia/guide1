# ðŸ’³ Spend/Earn Crypto

Coinbase offers a debit card *(which works in laundromats and many stores yet not reliably for things like rent)* and we encourage you to ask for this debit card. As a Coinbase customer you will then receive 4% rewards in XLM, whenever you make a purchase using the card. The card runs on USDC, a special type of crypto called a stablecoin because they have fixed values. USDC is, predictably, the U.S. Dollar Coin, which is fantastic compared to rivals like Tether and DAI but more on that in an upcoming post.

### So, here's the recommended logistical process for easily spending crypto:

1. Apply for the Coinbase debit card
2. Once you have the card, keep some of your Coinbase Portfolio as USDC
3. Spend the USDC balance like a cash balance
4. Earn 4% back as Stellar (XLM) within minutes

You can choose to convert the XLM reward _(for free!)_ to Cosmos (ATOM), which is an established crypto that yields 5% APR to all holders. Or you can get a similar deal when you choose Algorand (ALGO), which is another staking blockchain _(that seems strategically undervalued versus ATOM (Not Financial Advice))_.

> Another nice feature of the Coinbase debit card is that you don't need to worry about overdraft; the account will not allow this and will warn you immediately with an app popup. There's no penalty if it happens.

### So now that you know how to buy, earn, and even generate passive income with crypto, how about more of that last bit?

Read on for some starter info on how to stake your crypto for even bigger APRs than the numbers listed above.
