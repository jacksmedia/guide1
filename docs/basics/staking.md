# 🏗🏯 Stake Crypto

## What Staking Means

Staking is when you hold your funds in place, and you earn rewards. This is the exact thing that happens with investment tools like mutual funds. Because people love portfolio items that simply generate *passive yields*, and because  blockchain smart contracts easily lend themselves to building financial tools like these, crypto in 2021 is blooming into a large new industry calling itself Decentralised Finance (DeFi).

## How To Stake

When you own ATOM or ALGO you receive rewards directly into your wallet every few weeks, as people and apps use these blockchains. Yet it's not just these cryptos that make up DeFi. Most blockchains allow for smart contracts, so most blockchains have DeFi tools now. The examples below are from HarmonyONE, a stupendous Ethereum clone that is 1000x cheaper to use. 

Locking up funds is called "providing liquidity" and is a cool technique for making money with money that anyone can learn.

### 1. Providing (Adding) Liquidity

Gluing two crypto tokens together creates a public investment tool called a *Liquidity Pool token*.

These LP tokens require gas fees to make and unmake, yet they will reward you like ATOM or ALGO whenever users interact with your Pool! 

If you want multiple rewards you can also lock these funds into Farms or Vaults, similar tools that will multiply the LP investment and often reward you with a second token as well. 


### 2. Stake LP Tokens into a Pool, Farm, Vault, etc 
Once you stake your LPs into a Pool or Farm you start earning extra yield, because the Pool will pay you back in LP tokens and possibly another token, too! Secondary yield is part of the magic of DeFi.

This [Mochiswap](https://harmony.mochiswap.io/farms) farm will yield both more JEWEL-HMOCHI tokens and MOCHI tokens. Double yield from farming with Liquidity Pool tokens!

> This is almost exactly how the EGLD-MEX pair works on Maiar Exchange: you glue together EGLD and MEX tokens, then you can stake/farm with those LPs-- no growth in your LPs on Maiar, unfortunately, so it pays to DYOR and use many types of DeFi tools on many different blockchains!

Huge varieties of LP combinations exist, representing micro-sized versions of traditional lending exchanges. The Pools run automatically thanks to smart contracts, and this is why the crypto markets never close, either...

DeFi is brazenly built to disrupt the existing financial system, and will continue to innovate in this direction. 

Stay tuned for more upcoming DeFi content, such as how to stake your money in Pools, Farms, and Vaults: three tools that yield generous passive income for liquidity providers. This will stretch your imagination as well as your tech stamina, so prepare to earn these tasty APRs and APYs (yes, auto-compounding yields versus incremental percentage rates).
