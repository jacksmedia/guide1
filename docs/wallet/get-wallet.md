[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/) is the best option for just about everyone.  A mobile app that can hold any crypto from any blockchain, there's no reason for beginners to look elsewhere. Unless you plan on getting into blockchain gaming, in which case you may need to use a more exotic wallet app like [Math Wallet](https://mathwallet.org/en-us/). Come back and grab Math if you need it, and just DL [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/)! 


Below are example screens of what Trust Wallet looks like on Android. Apple devices will work similarly (YMMV).


## save your Key Words safely
When you first open Trust Wallet you will need to save some Key Words because this is how you can recover crypto. This can happen after you lose your phone and re-install Trust Wallet, so write them down and secure them somewhere.
