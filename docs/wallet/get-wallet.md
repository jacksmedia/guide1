# Even with Coinbase & Valora, You Still Need a Wallet

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/) is the best option for just about everyone.  A mobile app that can hold any crypto from any blockchain, there's no reason for beginners to look elsewhere. Unless...

> Are you already using the Brave Browser? If so, you can unlock its built-in crypto wallets and use it to store your currency. And let's get pragmatic for a moment here-- Brave is super useful if you prefer working on a laptop versus a phone. If this sounds like you, look into Brave Browser because it has other cool features like ad blocking, too! So ok, if you're a Brave user, open Brave Settings and you'll find a Wallet option on the left sidebar; this can accept ETH (Ethereuem), BTC (Bitcoin), BAT (Basic Attention Token) and many more currencies. Choose ETH & BAT for now, double check that you know your Brave account password, and then pat yourself on the back!

# Only Get MetaMask If...
Brave's wallet is similar to a Chrome Browser extension called [MetaMask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaMask).
MetaMask smoothed the way for crypto developers beginning in 2017. When you run your browser you automatically have access to crypto--  it's basically a wallet attached to Chrome. Unfortunately it's difficult to use now due to the age of the Ethereum v1 network, It may be of special interest if you plan to become a blockchain developer, because it gives access to test networks: if you're curious about learnign to developing your own DApps on Web3.0 or if you're wanting to play crypto games, then [do look into MetaMask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaMask) for yourself and check back here when you're ready.

# Download Trust Wallet
Let's avoid MetaMask for now and focus on [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/)! Go ahead and download it to your phone now, and let's head to the next step. Here's an example screen of what Trust Wallet looks like on android, while it swaps two very similar-looking tokens.
