## How to Add a New Token to [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/)

1. Balance is too low! Where are the new Polaris tokens I just swapped for?

Oh no, here's a common misadventure you'll encounter soon enough. Let's say I just swapped some BNB for a new token called Polaris but it's not showing up in my Wallet...

2. Research Contract

I need to head over to [CoinMarketCap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polaris-share/) to look up the Polaris token *contract address*.

3. Choose to Add when search fails

Then I'll click *Receive* button up top in Trust Wallet.

I'll search for 'Polaris', and when it doesn't show up, choose *Add Custom Token*

4. Add token contract

Then I can just Paste in the contract address that's copied. (Had to choose Smart Chain from the Network, first.)

The token metadata fills in automatically!

5. Refresh, tokens show up

After a *Swipe down to refresh* in Trust Wallet, I can now see the Polaris tokens show up!

6. Checking wallet balance vs the first screen, looks good again!

### The tokens were always in the wallet, they just weren't showing up.

If you ever can't find a new crypto you've acquired, check [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) or [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) for thousands of contract addresses to unlock these tokens in your Trust Wallet or MetaMask.
