# ðŸ‘› What Is a Crypto Wallet?

In this sense "wallets" are private accounts that can write data to blockchains. Crypto is open source and blockchains are freely available to access, yet their account recovery is 100% the responsibility of the owner. Please take your own financial security seriously-- there is no central authority whom you can email to reset your access keys. (But stay tuned for exchanges, in a moment.)

> The wallet keys are Twelve Words that you really ought to write down and store someplace safe.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) for phones and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) for Chrome-type browsers are the two mainstream crypto wallet apps. When you set up TrustWallet or MetaMask, the app will offer you the Twelve Words and it will strongly encourage you to save these words offline, in a very reliable and safe place. Please take this advice, and *never share the Twelve Words with anyone-- this is the exact same thing as giving away your wallet*.



So regarding your adventures in crypto going forward, just be careful and use your own best judgment and best note-taking tricks and you'll do great. Nobody can watch out for you better than yourself! Enjoy gaining power and fluency in the world of blockchains and crypto, and congratulations for learning about this strange new tech.

Seriously, NEVER share the 12 Words, the words = the wallet!

What about hardware wallets? Some people only feel safe when they "save" their crypto to a special hardware wallet, separate from their phone. Yet the crypto doesn't exist inside the hardware wallet, it's still on the blockchain. Guess what happens inside that fancy hardware, versus your smartphone or browser wallet app? Complex math that exactly equals the password strength of twelve randomized words. ðŸ˜¼ðŸ¤·

So it's your choice! With the simple strategy, when you change smartphones and have to update your wallet app, all you need to do is download the app again and then re-enter the dozen words. I prefer to use a small paper notebook and inexpensive phones in this simple strategy, versus a unique and expensive piece of hardware that will almost certainly *permanently remove my access to my blockchain money* if it turns into a brick... but YMMV. Some people really love hardware.

Whether you rely on a hardware wallet or not, you will always be accessing your crypto by accessing a blockchain.

We cannot erase blockchain data! The tech only allows for writing more data, so it's actually a super-transparent ledger and not very helpful to black markets and white collar criminals. The biggest occupational risk for a hacker these days is not using enough different crypto wallets for their crimes, because they get caught easily when police simply follow [the public transaction data on the blockchains](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)!

Wallets write to blockchains, exchanges write to blockchains. So why use an exchange at all, when you have complete control over your own wallet, and exchanges can lock down or delay access to funds? We believe that the #1 reason for most people seems to be that an exchange account is recoverable. Emailing Coinbase when you forget your password will lead to a reset and recovery situation, whereas if you lose your notebook with your wallet words, you've effectively lost all access to your crypto.

> Another reason to work with exchanges even once you become fluent moving crypto around using just your wallet is simplicity.

Exchanges (like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jacks_pv)) help to quickly convert your crypto between different chains-- you can do this with a wallet, too, but you may need to visit several swaps or dexes & pay multiple small transaction (gas) fees and it's a chore to do by hand when an exchange has this all automated with code contracts and will likely  cost you less (more on this when we get to Layer 1 and Layer 2 tech).
